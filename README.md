# Elixir Estonia workshop on visualisation with ggplot 2 2023-05-02

The idea was to use this template for the workshop, but decided against that and used Rstudio with Rmd instead as it is more interactive.
Currently the html (knitted) version of document was distributed to the trainees as well, but it might be worth while to add the knitted version
here instead.

Make the Rmd file aviable for download, add install instructions (requirements) for R, Rstudio, tidyverse (and ggplot) packages. That should be everything that is needed to follow the workshop.
